Just read that Nobel Laureate John Nash of *A Beautiful Mind* fame was [killed in a car accident](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/science/john-f-nash-jr-mathematician-whose-life-story-inspired-a-beautiful-mind-dies-at-86.html?module=Notification&version=BreakingNews&region=FixedTop&action=Click&contentCollection=BreakingNews&contentID=34886947&pgtype=Homepage). He changed economics and made countless contributions to mathematics. This is a sad day.

He published only a handful of papers, each highly cited and important.  His dissertation was 27 pages long.
