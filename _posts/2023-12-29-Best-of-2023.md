title: Best of 2023
---
While it's been a great year for new music, it's been a bad year for writing about new music.  Still, I thought my Best Of list from last year worked so well I would do it again.  Worked well in that I got no hate mail, which is pretty good for today's world.

And there you go.  Once again, no discipline, no thought, just what I remember and ratings throughout the year.

So what was my favorite?  _Hadsel_ from Beirut, _Rollin'_ from Erik Truffaz, _portrait of a dog_ from Jonah Yano, _Uncle John's Band_ from John Scofield, _Aging_ from Kevin Drew, _Stings_ from Kamaal Williams, and _Angel Numbers_ from Hamish Hawk would all get votes, but my favorite albums tend to change from day to day.  Except Steely Dan.  Steely Dan is always on the list.

Peace.
