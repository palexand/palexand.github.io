[GitHub](https://github.com) has just announced a program where
students and faculty can get GitHub micro accounts at no cost.  Read
about it [here](https://github.com/blog/1775-github-goes-to-school).
The micro account allows you to have a private repo so not
everyone can see your code.

This is awesome.  I use GitHub to host all my projects, websites and
classes.
