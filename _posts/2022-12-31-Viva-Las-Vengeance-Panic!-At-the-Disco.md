Checking out Best of lists from [All Music](https://www.allmusic.com) trolling for new music and ran across the latest from [Panic! At the Disco](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/16184), a peppy little jaunt titled [Viva Las Vengeance](https://tidal.com/browse/album/242542593).  Stopped me in my tracks.  Panic! has been around forever and I've glanced at them many, many times.  For whatever reason, this one stopped me dead in my tracks.  What a great pop album!  You can throw all the "alt" modifiers in that you want, but this is a pop album and a great pop album in the spirit of [Spoon](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/32458) or [fun](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3762073). with a bit of [Queen]() mixed in for good measure.  Not one sad note on the entire album.
