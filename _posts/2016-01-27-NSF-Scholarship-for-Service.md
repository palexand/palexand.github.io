title: NSF Scholarship for Service
---

KU and ITTC just won an [NSF Scholarship for Service](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2016/jan/27/ku-gets-47m-grant-train-future-government-cybersec/) grant that will allow us to sponsor students studying cybersecurity.  If you are an interested student, please do let me know.  I'm excited for us to get good students in the pipeline.
