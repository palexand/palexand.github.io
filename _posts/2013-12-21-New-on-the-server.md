New tunes on the server since my last update:

* *The Happiness Waltz* - Josh Rouse
* *Repentance* - Jordan Klassen
* *Don't Tell the Driver* - Mick Turner
* *Blue Rider* - Zachary Cale
* *Dectet: Subjects and Complements* - Justin Morel
* *Frames* - Brian Haas and Matt Chamberlain

All good stuff.  I'm quite happy with everything and the new Josh
Rouse in particular.  Also discovered a new music download site on
recommendation of a good music friend:

* [HDTracks](http://www.hdtracks.com)

Happy listening.
