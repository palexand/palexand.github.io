title: Circus School
---
I just learned today that Lawrence has a Circus School.  [The Last Carnival](https://www.sihkaanndestroy.com/) is advertised as the 'first and only school for Circus Arts in Lawrence Kansas.' Like there would be more than one!  How cool is that?  My town has a circus school should I need a second career or just want to learn how to hang from stuff artistically. In need to see if they have elephants and clown cars.  I would truly love to have a clown car for faculty meetings.
