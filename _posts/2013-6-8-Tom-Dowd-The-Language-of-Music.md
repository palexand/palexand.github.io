title: Tom Dowd and The Language of Music
---

Years ago I saw a documentary when doing laps around the television
about [Tom Dowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Dowd).  Dowd was a
recording engineer and producer for 
Atlantic Records and was among the first to use stereo and multitrack
recording techniques.  He also worked on the Manhattan Project and
made the decision to go into recording when his classified work was
more advanced than academia would acknowledge. 

After seeing the documentary, I promptly forgot Dowd's name and the
name of the documentary!  I've talked about the moving and recommended
it multiple times without either name.  Well, I finally found the name
and you can get the DVD through Netflix.  It's called *Tom Dowd and The
Language of Music*.  Most definitely worth your time.
