# Artists, Music and Gear

I keep a [blog](blog.html) where I describe some of the artists and
music I listen 
to and the stereo gear that I use for playback.I find it exceedingly
difficult to find new music that I enjoy. My interests are pretty
eclectic ranging from jazz through indie pop and folk to ska with
about everything in between, except what you hear on the
radio. Although the web has changed things for the better, it's still
difficult to find new artists that I like. I also tend to be a bit of
a gear-head - I like listening and learning about home audio gear. I
have also put together some advice for first time high-end stereo
buyers. To make a long story short, I'm a big fan of Bryston and
Classe amplification, Benchmark DACs, HeadRoom headphone amps and
Entymotic and Senheiser headphones. I also have Snell type C/V
speakers and CAL digital sources that I love, but both of those
companies have since been purchased and I'm not sure if and how they
have changed. Visit the blog and select the music keyword for artists
and music or the gear keyword for info on playback systems. Taste is
personal -- your mileage my vary.

# Bio

I started my University studies at The University of Kansas majoring
in Trumpet Performance. I had every intent of becoming a jazz
musician, but something happened along the way. A great deal of it was
realizing what it meant to be a professional musician and realizing
the danger of making your avocation your vocation. I ended up
receiving the BSCS and BSEE degrees in 1986, continuing to perform in
ensembles throughout my undergraduate studies.

From there I joined the Telecommunication and Information Sciences Lab
(TISL) at KU working on the COEDS project, developing a CAD system for
evaluating telecommunications systems with respect to electromagnetic
compatibility. Funny thing is that prior to COEDS I ranted quite a bit
about how much I hated electromagnetics, telecommunications and Lisp,
and how I would never need to know any of them. During this project, I
was exposed to two things that continue to play an important role in
my research - functional programming and systems engineering. I
received the MSEE degree in 1988 and the PhD in 1992, both under
Dr. Gary Minden.

After completing my PhD, I left KU and Kansas, joining the Electrical
and Computer Engineering Department at the University of
Cincinnati. While at UC I began to pursue interests in formal methods
and automated software engineering. I founded and directed the
Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Laboratory and worked on several
DARPA and AFRL funded research projects. I also began integrating
formal methods into undergraduate computer engineering courses,
receiving some national attention for that effort.  

After 8 great years at Cincinnati, I moved back to Kansas as an
Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
and a principal investigator with the Information and
Telecommunications Technology Center. In 2005 I was promoted to
Professor. My interests in formal methods continued and with David
Barton and Peter Ashenden, I developed the Rosetta systems-level
specification language.  Work on Rosetta continues with an IEEE
standard in the works. I've published on book with Morgan Kaufman with
plans for a second. I also find myself looking more at language
interpreters and ways of mixing computational models during analysis
activities, as well as traditional analysis activities.

Most recently I have begun work verifying and designing trusted
systems. I have worked on verification of a trusted OS built using the
Xen infrastructure and have worked on the first formal model of the
TPM 1.2.  Currently we are working on moving trusted computing into
the cloud and on discovering malice in embedded computing devices such
as printers, MFDs and routers.
