Should you not be familiar with [Kevin Drew](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3586461), he is a founding member of [_Broken Social Scene_](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3558791) a Canadian band/collective that produces some of the best, outside-the-box, chamber pop you will ever hear.  _Broken Social Scene_ is a band I follow closely and deeply admire.  Amazing compositions and performances that vary in highly intelligent and artistic ways.  Definitely one of my "desert island" bands.

[_Aging_](https://tidal.com/browse/album/324632440) is a 2023 release by Kevin Drew that is the latest in a series of solo works supported by _Broken Social Scene_.  There is nothing subtle about the title. Like many of us, Drew is dealing with aging, midlife and all the things that come with it.  Dealing with an imperfect, increasingly difficult world that was not made by us.

The album builds from its opening track "Elevators" with pulsing bass drum and piano building to a quiet vocal.  Classic Kevin Drew.  The album is quieter than usual
