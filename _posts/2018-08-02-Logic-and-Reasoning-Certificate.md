title: Logic and Reasoning Certificate
---
The KU Department of Philosphy has develpoped a certificate in [Logic and Formal Reasoning](https://catalog.ku.edu/liberal-arts-sciences/philosophy/logic-formal-reasoning-ucert/#certificaterequirementstext) that looks ideal for undergraduates looking to work in formal methods, language semantics, or theoretical computer science.  Note that EECS 210 and MATH 558 - two courses I always recommend - are both included in the certificate.  If interested, please let me know and I'll put you in touch with my friends in Philosphy.
