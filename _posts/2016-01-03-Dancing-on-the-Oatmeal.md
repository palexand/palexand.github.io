title: Dancing on The Oatmeal

As many of you know, [The Oatmeal](https://theoatmeal.com) is my favorite site in the web-o-sphere.  Highly irreverent and often not safe for work, but not for the usual reasons.  It often makes me laugh really, really hard.

While perusing unread blog posts last might, I ran across this post about [Matt](https://theoatmeal.com/blog/where_matt).  I'll not spoil it for you by trying to describe it, but let's just say I can't find a thing to post about to start 2016.  Go Matt!
