So what is this doing here? Glen Campbell the pop country balladeer among the
hip and cool jazz and Steely Dan.  I just heard a great cover of "Wichita
Lineman" by Kurt Elling and thought I would go hunting.  I found quite a lot and
rekindled a love for this music.

"Wichita Lineman" is a classic ballad by Jimmy Webb that was originally
performed by Glen Campbell on the album of the same name.  We all know that.
But how did this come to be?  Glen Campbell was a member of The Wrecking Crew,
the famed west coast house band that backed an astonishing collection of albums
in the 60's and 70's.  These folks were A-list studio players and Glen Campbell
was among their best even though he couldn't read music.  Hal Blaine and Carol
Kay were there among many others.  But Glen Campbell was every bit an A-List
guitar player.

It's also important to know how house bands like The Wrecking Crew, The Funk
Brothers, and Booker T and the MGs worked.  The stars would bring in a half
written idea for a song.  The band would flesh it out during rehearsal and make
it work.  Then they would record.  Key in this is the band's contribution to the
song itself.  This happened all the time and was considered normal in the
business.  Unfortunately, house bands rarely got album credits and thus no
residuals or public recognition for their work.

Glenn Campbell emerged from The Wrecking Crew as a music and movie star.  Played
opposite John Wayne in _True Grit_ for example.  Even had his own variety show.
He was a star and became a star playing songs by Jimmy Webb.  During this period
musicians rarely wrote their own music.  Instead they got their songs from
commercial music publishers like the Brill Building or independents like the
aforementioned Jimmy Webb.

Jimmy had written big hits for Glenn Campbell called "By The Time I Get To Phoenix"
and "Galveston".  Campbell wanted to ride the wave of these geographical songs
and called on Webb to quickly write a new song for him.  That song was inspired
by the solitary men who worked the phone and electric lines in west Texas where
the highways were straight and the people few and far between.  I have no idea
what possessed Jimmy Webb to believe there was anything romantic about shimmying
up a phone pole.  But somehow it worked.

Webb delivered the "Wichita Lineman" demo in very rough form.  Typical of the
songs The Wrecking Crew filled out all the time.  Campbell took the demo to the
studio, Carol Kay filled in the base parts and the strings followed.  When Jimmy
Web didn't hear back from Campbell he assumed that he did not like the song.  On
the contrary, Campbell had already cut the tracks.  Webb panicked because the
song was not done.  So much so that he hauled the organ from his home into the
studio to add to the mix.  It had to be that organ from that house to get that
sound excactly that that demo.

The rest is history as they say.  "Wichita Lineman" was a huge, multi-platinum
hit.  Bob Dylan claims it is the best song ever written.  It has been covered
over 280 times.  Think about that.  Artists ranging from big band crooners like
Kurt Elling to jazz singers like Cassandra Wilson to rockers like REM have
recorded their own versions of "Wichita Lineman".  There is truly something
about that song.  Yes it is structurally different and leaves an unresolved
chord at the end and features a bass solo from Carol Kay.  All that aside, it is
just a beautiful song that came together in a unique and haphazard way.  Here's
to serendipity.
