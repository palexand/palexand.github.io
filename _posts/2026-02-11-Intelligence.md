title: Intelligence

Yesterday I had a blast giving an overview of AI and LLMs to a class of law and
business students studying at University of Buffalo.  My friend Bert Westbrook
invited me to give the talk and I could not say no.  It forced me to codify much
of what I understand about LLMs and the current state of computing as well as
talk about some history I love.

I put together my slides in Keynote which I've grown to love over the years.
Keynote just went through a major update that introduced AI features for a
monthly fee.  I'm sure you're surprised by this because no one else ever
considered it.  Snarkiness aside, I decided to try out the AI features by
generating an image for each slide from the title of the slide.  Here is an
example of what was generated for the prompt "The AI Winter":

I think this is a pretty cool image and was starting to warm up to the whole
idea of AI assistance.

But then reality hits.  

The last slide in my presentation is titled "Is This Intelligence?".  I
dutifully prompted the Apple AI for an image.  Here is the slide with the image
embedded:

I don't know whether to laugh or cry...
