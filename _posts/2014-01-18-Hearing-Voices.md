title: Hearing Voices
---
I just downloaded a remastered 192/24 version of *Waltz for Debbie* by the
great Bill Evans Trio featuring Bill Evans, Scott LaFarro, and Paul
Motian from my friends at [HDTracks](http://www.hdtracks.com).  This
is of course the first great live jazz trio album and maybe the best
ever. I've used it in stereo auditions since I bought it because of
the phenomenal sound stage and the subtle artifacts - voices and sounds
of people eating and drinking - that remain from the live show.

My earlier forays into high-definition remasters have all been
positive.  Subtle differences, but positive.  Cymbals are clearer (no
more frying bacon to quote Chuck Chiles), attacks and releases
crisper, more room sounds and natural reverb, a general cleanness to
the sound.  Mind you, this may be because of remastering and not
higher resolution, but it is noticeable on my rig.

*Waltz for Debbie* takes this to a whole new place for me.  All of the
 things I love about the recording are amplified by the higher sampling
 rate and remastering.  I'm hearing voices - not the kind in my head -
 new voices and sounds of the room in the album I never heard before.
 I didn't realize how much I love those sounds.  If I was there I
 would be shushing the idiots talking during a Bill Evans show, but on
 the recording they put you in the room in a rather serious and
 sometimes startling way.
 
 The music has the same good properties that are enhanced in other
 high definition recordings I've listened to.  Probably the biggest
 changes are drums, reverb, and the piano.  I think drum sounds are
 exceptionally hard to reproduce.  Particularly snare and cymbals.
 Lo-res cymbals can kill a recording.  Here, the cymbals are bright
 and ring like cymbals should.  Reverb is harder to describe.  There
 is a sound that continues after a release that is a reflection of the
 room the recording is in.  Listen to *Kind of Blue* for a
 particularly good example of this.  The reverb of the club this
 recording is in stands out.  Again, you feel like you're in the front
 row.  Finally, a piano is a percussion instrument.  You hit the
 strings with hammers.  The piano is also a resonator - not a point
 source of sound.  The whole piano produces and amplifies the sound.
 Attacks should be clear an crisp.  Releases, particularly with the
 sustain pedal comes up, should be immediate.  All of those things
 come across fabulously on this remaster.
 
 I would have to say my exploration of high definition music is an
 unqualified success.  I was skeptical to the point of not buying
 anything for fear of not hearing any differences.  I honestly tried
 *not* to hear anything.  It's there and I find it wonderful.  Your
 mileage may of course vary.  Listen to what you like and don't pay
 for anything you can't hear...
