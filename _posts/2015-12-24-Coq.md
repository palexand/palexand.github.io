About 7 months ago I started exploring new theorem provers for use in my lab and teaching.  I am a diehard [PVS](https://pvs-wiki.csl.sri.com/index.php/Main_Page) fan and that really hasn't changed.  The folks at SRI produced a tool that shaped my teaching and research for years.  I just got a bit stir crazy and wanted to check out something completely different.

Enter [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).  I've been fascinated by my PL friends obsession with the tool generally and the application or Curry-Howard specifically, so I started through Pierce's [Software Foundations](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html) and later Chlipala's [Certified Programming with Dependent Types](https://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/) to learn more.  In a word, I'm hooked.  I've moved my formal methods class to Coq as well as my current research projects.  I'm not yet as productive in Coq as I am in PVS, but I'm getting there.

I don't yet have anything significant to offer the Coq community in thanks.  I hope to develop an undergraduate online text, but that's a ways off.  For now, I will do several blog entries that capture my learning process, things I've found interesting, and some teaching experiences with the tool.  If you find any of this useful, give me a shout.  More importantly, if anything is wrong, give me a shout.
