[Ben Howard](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3643740) is a new artist to me that hits a sweet spot near experimental pop and singer songwriter.  Dreamy pop sounds that remind me immediately of [José González](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3520832) who I spotted last year.  Ben Howard leans less towards folk and more towards pop and experimental, although that turn seems recent.  The singing voices are wonderfully similar.  Smooth, silky, etherial.

[Is It?](https://tidal.com/browse/album/297509967) is Howard's latest and it is amazing, sophisticated pop music. Hard to decide which tracks to describe, so I'll start with the opener, _Couldn't Make It Up_.  All the elements of the album are there.  Lots of effects and synths, but definitely the poppiest song on the album.  Likely a radio hit back in the 90s.  Don't stop here.

_Walking Backwards_ picks up where _Couldn't Make It Up_ with just a bit more edge.  The more experimental side of Howard begins to emerge and keeps coming through _Days of Lantana_ and _Moonraker_, one of my favorites.

_Interim of Sense_ combines some groovy guitar effects with Howard's voice to create one of the more outside songs on the album.

_Spirit_ is particularly compelling with a somewhat dissonant opening using what sounds like a cello with heavy effects and a kick drum all over the place, but not quite on the beat.  The result is far more amazing than I make it sound.  If you listen to one of Howard's songs, this is the one.

I will find this on vinyl.  It really is a fine album from top to bottom that struck me from first listen.  Difficult to imagine a better album so far this year.
