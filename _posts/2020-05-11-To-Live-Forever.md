title: To Live Forever
---
There are a couple of online comic strips that I read religiously.
[XKCD](https://xkcd.com) is of course one and [Saturday Morning
Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com/) would be
another.  My favorite is [The Oatmeal](https://theoatmeal.com).  The
writing is brilliant and thoughtful. The comics just seem to hit home
for me almost every time I read one.

This recent post on how to [live
forever](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/be_kind) simply could not be
more true.
