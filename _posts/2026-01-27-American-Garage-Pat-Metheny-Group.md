The year is 1978, and I am a junior at Platte County R-III high school, sitting
Biology II learning something about critters or plants that I have long since
forgotten.  Our teacher, Mr. Goodlet, decides to show a film series called _The
Search for Solutions_.  Way back then we actually had projectors and physical
reels of file that got shown in class instead of the day's lectures.  We liked
that. Plus, _The Search for Solutions_ was good.  A series of films on novel
science projects that were actually quite interesting.

What stood out for me and my best friend Bryan Pearce was the music.  Modern,
guitar-based jazz that we just had to find.  _The Search for Solutions_ became
the search for a theme song.  We found it.  Not only did we find it, Bryan had a
cassette of the album that it came from.  "The Search" from Pat Metheny Group's
_American Garage_.  We rode around in Bryan's Honda Civic listening to that
cassette over and over.  "The Search" featured a piano solo from Lyle Mays that
is as close to perfect as anything I've heard.  Simple theme, add some tension,
rise up, then bring it home.  Just about perfect.

Of course Pat and Lyle went on to make a ton of amazing albums.  _American
Garage_ doesn't get much love these days, but it was important for me.  Music
that was jazz, but was modern and fresh.  It made us think about music and
thinking is good.  Today was a great day at the record store.  I found a near
mint copy of _American Garage_ and snapped it up immediately.  Now I just need a
Frisbee, Honda Civic and my old buddies Bryan and Lloyd Warden to make it
perfect.
