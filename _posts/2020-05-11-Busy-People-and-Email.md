I ran across this article on [how to get a busy person to respond to
your
email](https://byrslf.co/how-to-get-a-busy-person-to-respond-to-your-email-52e5d4d69671)
some time ago and never got around to posting it.  Great advice and
quite accurate.  On a busy day I get over 100 emails.  The easier you
make yours to read and respond to the more likely I will respond
quickly.  I always try to, but if it's hard I end up deferring until I
have more time.
