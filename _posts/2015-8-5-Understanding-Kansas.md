title: Understanding Kansas
---
I end up having quite a few discussions with colleagues on the coasts and overseas about how I can live in a completely insane state like Kansas. Particularly given my political leanings.  There are lots of reasons. Lawrence is consistently rated among the top 10 college towns in the US and has a fantastic arts and music scene. Then there's my 5 minute commute my wife's 3 minute commute. When the Oscar Meyer Wiener Mobile shows up in town it's front page news. Mainly it's my colleagues at KU who are outstanding scholars and better friends. But I digress.

Here's a [great article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/magazine/the-kansas-experiment.html) from the NY Times by a native son who now lives and works on the east coast.  Turns out its not nearly as insane here as the public caricatures make it out to be. The piece is more a human interest story than hardcore journalism, but it captures quite well what's happening in Kansas and the people responsible for it. Say what you want, but the Kansas legislature increased taxes this year to avoid cuts to K-12 schools and universities.
