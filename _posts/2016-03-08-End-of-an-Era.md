title: End of an Era
---
Before moving in the new speakers, I took one more picture of my system.  Although pieces have changed over the years - Audio Research LS16 for Classe, Parasound for Bryston, Benchmark for Cal Audio - my speakers have never changed.  The venerable Snell C/V have just been beautiful for almost 22 years.  I hate to see them go, but they will migrate into my son's first stereo.  Something quite appropriate about that.
