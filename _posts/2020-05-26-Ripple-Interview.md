Big thank you to Ripple for sponsoring our research and allowing me to
visit last year.  They did this nice
[interview](https://ripple.com/insights/on-campus-university-of-kansas-emphasizes-interdisciplinary-blockchain-study-for-budding-entrepreneurs/)
while I was there that I'm just now getting around to adding.  Watch
for much new cool stuff from our UBRI projects related to art,
biological information, and resilience.
