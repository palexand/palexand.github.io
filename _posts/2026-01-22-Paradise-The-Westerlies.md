It is sometimes said that classical music will rewire your mind.  I believe
there are scientific studies that attempt to empirically verify such phenomenon.
I’m going out on a limb to say that _Paradise_ will rewire your mind.  There is
something magical about a brass quintet or a jazz combo.  Everyone brings their
note and every note is important.  It isn’t the root that defines a chord, but
the stuff in the middle.  The flatted seventh or the minor third. That is how I
enjoyed playing the most - when I brought my note and mixed it with the other
notes.  Sometimes the top, sometimes the bottom, sometimes in the middle, but
ever-present.  That is how I enjoy working.

_Paradise_ is rare indeed.  I think of it as a classical brass quintet album.
Oddly enough, Roon lists it as jazz.  Tidal doesn’t even try.  Call it what you
want, but I’ll bet money it will move you.  The opening track is a romp called
“Fight On” with the melody in the horn and trumpets serving as the rhythm
section.  Quite wonderful.  “Paradise” features one of my favorite
americana/folk singers Sam Amidon.  Left me speechless the first time I
listened.  Haunting, unhurried, uncomplicated gospel music that steals your
breath.  “Louisiana” sounds initially like something from Benjamin Britton, but
on closer listen you can hear echos of the old south pushing forward.

Unquestionably brilliant.  Among my top 5 of 2025.  Please give it a listen.
