I recently discovered this group while wandering around the musical landscape
that is Bruce Hornsby.  Back in my college days Bruce Hornsby was a radio celebrity
with Bruce Hornsby and The Range.  "The Way It Is" - his biggest hit - topped
the Billboard charts in 1986.  Shortly after
"Mandolin Rain" also from _The Way It Is_ charted at #4. The Bruce Hornsby sound
was and is defined by his piano work.  "The Way It Is" has an iconic piano riff
that is still in everyone's head.  Truly great rock music.

Hornsby could have stopped and joined the jukebox circuit playing his radio hits
for adoring crowds.  That is decidedly not what he did.  Instead, he became the
touring pianist with The Grateful Dead.  If you know The Dead you understand the
challenges of playing constantly changing, improvised music.  Hornsby blended
into the ensemble, did great things and seemingly had a great time.

Fast-forward to the 2010s.  Bruce Hornsby and The Noisemakers decide to play
The Lied Center in Lawrence, KS.  My wife and I had just had a great time at a
Kansas reunion concert
there, and I had not heard of The Noisemakers, so I checked out Tidal.
Listening to _The Way It Is_ seemed a great way to spend an evening.

Pam and I both agree that was the greatest evening of music we've ever seen.
Hands down.  Three encores, music that was equally challenging and uplifting.
Nothing ordinary, but nothing dissonant.  Bruce Hornsby emerged fully formed
from the Dead.  Literally.  The Noisemakers were fantastic, and I recommend any
of their albums.

Here I'm listening to _Deep Sea Vents_ from Brhym, a collaboration between Bruce
Hornsby and yMusic, one of my favorite classical ensembles.  This just could not
be a bad thing, so I went straight to the big system at home.  If I were to make
music again, this is the kind of music I would like to make.  I have no
illusions that I could, but a guy can dream, right?

"The Wild Whaling Life" opens the album with what one can only call a modern
folk song.  The story of, well, a whaler.  The trumpet work is brief, but
brilliant.

"Theory of Everything" is a more challenging listen with a bit more dissonance
and modern phrasing.  "Platypus Wow" even more so.  But Hornsby does a great job
of mixing the difficult with the soothing.  I've always said that great art
creates and resolves dissonance.  _Deep Sea Vaults_ does exactly that at an
album level and "Phase Change" brings us back to more tonal, classically
inspired work.

Skipping forward, "The Baited Line" is a gorgeous, modern folk tune.  Haunting
trumpet and Hornsby-esque harmonies.  While I would not call this Celtic music
in any real way, the use of whistles and fiddle draw from that tradition in a
truly beautiful way.

I am remiss in not mentioning yMusic to this point.  They are co-equal with
Hornsby.  Modern classical music is among my favorite genres and yMusic are
masters.

"Deep Sea Vents" closes the album with a Dixieland inspired feel. Not what I
expected, but somehow a fitting close.

Give _Deep Sea Vents_ a listen.  Definitely worth your time and different in a
way that will compel you.
