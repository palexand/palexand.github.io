I wrote about my very cool new BDP-2 that now serves up all my music.
Now I'm looking at getting all my Macs out of my principle playback
paths.  The sound room is now good to go, but I would like to use the
BDP-2 elsewhere in the house.  I see two options.  One is to use
ethernet to deliver bits from my BDP-2 to wherever I need them.  There
is some appeal to this solutoin as I already have wireless everywhere
in the house.  Another is to use a dedicated wireless DAC or possibly
a Sonos system.  The wireless DAC is a nice alternative with a
wireless signal dedicated to moving sound from my BDP-2 to where ever
I might need it.  The Sonos is interesting because I have the network
in place.

I'm going to check out a solution by
[Audioengine](https://audioengineusa.com) that is billed as a wireless
DAC.  The digital stuff moves from a transmitter to the DAC that is
connected to your sound reproduction system.  This has great
potential.  Stay tuned for more information on this.
