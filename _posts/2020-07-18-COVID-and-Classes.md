title: COVID and Classes
---
I'm starting to get questions from students and a few parents about my
classes this coming fall. I'm cannot say anything official or
represent KU, but I can tell you that I plan to teach live
from the classroom, fully masked while taking appropriate precautions. I
will also do my utmost to accommodate those who are concerned about a
live classroom situation.  Specifically, I am
planning to record lectures prior to or during class, hold
online exams, and hold online office hours. My projects and
homeworks have been online for years and will remain so.

While this is all kind of nuts we are learning we are stronger and
more resilient than we thought. When this thing passes we will be a
better University and a better community. Some things are going to be
different, but our commitment to research and education is
invariant over COVID.
