title: Banach-Tarski in the news
---
This, folks, is why I read [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com) for my news. A description of the behavior of participants in the first Fox Republican Presidential Candidate Debate:

> OK, these guys aren’t statisticians, so normally I’d be nice, but they seem to have trouble counting to “one” when asked about their “first” executive order. Unless they’re drawing inspiration from Banach–Tarski.

Wow.  A reporter, [Leah Libresco](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/leah-libresco/), used Banach-Tarski to describe something that was done during the republican presidential debate.  That is just too cool. [Leah Libresco](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/leah-libresco/) is officially now my favorite reporter of all time.  I would gladly host her for a talk and buy her a Yello Sub if she came to Lawrence.
