# Artists, Music and Gear

I keep a [blog](blog.html) where I describe some of the artists and
music I listen to and the stereo gear that I use for playback. I find
it exceedingly 
difficult to find new music that I enjoy. My interests are pretty
eclectic ranging from jazz through indie pop and folk to ska with
about everything in between. Although the web has changed things for
the better, it's still 
difficult to find new artists that I like.

I also tend to be a bit of
a gear-head - I like listening and learning about home audio gear. I
have also put together some advice for first time high-end stereo
buyers. To make a long story short, I'm a big fan of ATI, Bryston and
Classe amplification, Benchmark DACs, 
Grado, Entymotic and Sennheiser headphones. I also have Snell type C/V
speakers and CAL digital sources that I love, but both of those
companies have since been purchased and killed off. Visit the blog and
select the music keyword for artists 
and music or the gear keyword for info on playback systems. Taste is
personal -- your mileage will vary.

# Great Band Names

In my travels I've come up with some really geat band names, none of
which will ever be used. I'm going to list a few here. If you want to
use one for your band, please do let me know.  I would be deeply
honored.

- Undecidability of Monotonic Happiness - Best for an emo band I
  think.

# Bio

I started my University studies at The University of Kansas majoring
in Trumpet Performance. I had every intent of becoming a jazz
musician, but something happened along the way. A great deal of it was
realizing what it meant to be a professional musician and realizing
the danger of making your avocation your vocation. I ended up
receiving the BSCS and BSEE degrees in 1986, continuing to perform in
ensembles throughout my undergraduate studies.

From there I joined the Telecommunication and Information Sciences Lab
(TISL) at KU working on the COEDS project, developing a CAD system for
evaluating telecommunications systems with respect to electromagnetic
compatibility. Funny thing is that prior to COEDS I ranted quite a bit
about how much I hated electromagnetics, telecommunications and Lisp,
and how I would never need to know any of them. During this project, I
was exposed to two things that continue to play an important role in
my research - functional programming and systems engineering. I
received the MSEE degree in 1988 and the PhD in 1992, both under
Dr. Gary Minden.

After completing my PhD, I left KU and Kansas, joining the Electrical
and Computer Engineering Department at the University of
Cincinnati. While at UC I began to pursue interests in formal methods
and automated software engineering. I founded and directed the
Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Laboratory and worked on several
DARPA and AFRL funded research projects. I also began integrating
formal methods into undergraduate computer engineering courses,
receiving some national attention for that effort.

After 8 great years at Cincinnati, I moved back to Kansas as an
Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
and a principal investigator with the Information and
Telecommunications Technology Center. In 2005 I was promoted to
Professor. My interests in formal methods continued and with David
Barton and Peter Ashenden, I developed the Rosetta systems-level
specification language.  We published one book with Morgan Kaufman and
the beginnings of an IEEE standard and while the ideas behind Rosetta
live on in systems engineering languages like AADL and SySML, the
Rosetta effort ended in the mid 2000s. I continue to find myself
looking at language 
interpreters and ways of mixing computational models during analysis
activities, as well as traditional analysis activities.

Now we work at the intersection of formal methods and remote
attestation.  I initially worked on
verification of a trusted system virtual platform built using the 
Xen infrastructure and then on moving trusted computing into
the cloud. I was lead PI on the University of Kansas NSA Science of
Security Lablet where we continued developing verified trusted computing
semantics and infrastructure.  Other Science of Security projects at
KU examined IoT privacy, resilience ontology and epistemology, side
channel attack resistance, and secure native binary execution.  I am
was also PI on the DARPA CASE effort with Collins Aerospace developing
verified trusted computing infrastructure for a UAV ground station.

Work with NSA on trusted systems continues as a part of the Trusted
Systems Virtual Institute.  We continue to expand attestation
capabilies by develping a semantics for evidence, a taxonomy of
flexible attestation mechanisms, and performing empirical case
studies.

Among my interdisciplinary adventures is working through a gift
from Ripple's University Blockchain Initiative (UBRI) to explore
various aspects of blockchain and its impacts. I am working with
biodiversity researchers to tokenize 
biological data, working with artists and writers to explore social
impacts, and developing tools to protect blockchain infrastructure.
