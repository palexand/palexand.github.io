Here are some pictures of the prototype system. Completely haphazard
setup on the bar in the back of my sound room. I should say, what will
be my sound room.

First, before I got a rack for the input equipment. You can see on of
the ATI amps on the ground with 7 channels comeing out.  The DSP s on
the left with the Bechmark D/A on top. Audio Research preamp is on the
right.

I bought a rack that I'll use for inputs.  Here it is empty by the
amp.

Finally set up properly with inputs, preamp and DSP in the rack. This
is sort of what things will look like when the room is done.  Not
quite though.
