title: Science is hard
---
I read Nate Silver's online news service [FiveThirtyEight](www.fivethirtyeight.com) just about every day.  Nice, insightful news backed by research and data analysis rather than random opinions and emotion.  This morning I read a fantastic piece called [Science Isn't Broken](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/) that talks about why establishing causation and predicting outcomes in the social sciences is hard.  Until I got to know some social scientists, I had no idea how hard.  It's a lengthy read, but it does an outstanding job of describing the pitfalls social science researchers deal with every day.  Cool stuff and worth a read.
