titie: New on the Bryston
---
Wandered down to the lab a couple of weeks back and a student asked why I stopped posting to my blog.  Not sure, but I took this as an indication that someone other than me actually looks at the thing.  So, I decided to make a comeback and start posting here again rather than only the lab music slack channel.  I'm starting slowly with a list of new tunes on the Bryston.  The Bryston, for those of you who don't know, is my digital music player where all my music lives.  I want to say New on the Turntable, but that doesn't work anymore.  Regardless, here's a list of what new things got played this week:

* _World Domination Part I: Furie_ by Tin Men and The Telephone - Rather outside, but tuneful jazz.  Pretty awsesome stuff even if you're like me and tend to avoid the free side of jazz.
* _Heart Tonic_ by Caroline Davis - More modern jazz.  Quite happy with this one.  Modern, but still swinging jazz.
* _Heaven & Earth_ by Kamasi Washington - Yet more modern jazz with all kinds of influences.  This is definitely his best work yet.  Can't get it off my playlist.
* _Kiss Your Darlings_ by I Think You're Awesome - Sounds like some kind of country thing, but definitely not.  Listed under jazz, but I would label it more progressive than jazz.  Still really good.
* _Come Tomorrow_ by The Dave Mathews Band - It's a Dave Mathews album, so it's darn good.  Missing the violin and sax players which definitely changes the sound, but still worth your time.
* _While We're At It_ by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones - I love the Bosstones.  I've said repeatedly that if they came to town looking for a horn player I'm packing up Tate, Pam, Ruby and PoPo and hitting the road.  This is not on the level of their earlier work, but it's not fair to expect that.  Still worth your time.

Back later with some additional tunes and comments on new gear and software.
