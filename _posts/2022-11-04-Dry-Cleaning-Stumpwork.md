Latest by Dry Cleaning is _Stumpwork_.  It is another Dry Cleaning album in every sense - really cool spoken word and sparse, plodding guitars and drums.  Plodding in a good sense if there is such a thing.  Unhurried and unselfconscious with drums and jangly guitar that drag things along like a punk band that doesn't care.  Ho hum.  Ho hum indeed!  Until _Don't Press Me_ hits and the tempo pops up, there's just a hint of lilt in the vocals, and the guitarist turns up the surf knob.

There's a ton to like here.  One would think that this band would drone on, but there are little hooks - sax riff at the end of _Conservative Hell_, actual sining on _Don't Press Me_, outside the chords noise on _Liberty Long_ - that pop up and demand your attention.  You might even smile.

I dug Dry Cleaning's first album _New Long Leg_, listened quite a bit, and will be listening to this one quite a bit as well.  Probably get a copy on vinyl as it's a vinyl kind of album.  One that would get played on the _High Fidelity_ soundtrack if _High Fidelity_ were made today.  Certainly worth your streaming pleasure and vinyl worthy.
